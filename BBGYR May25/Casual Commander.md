>Gold lobby with random teammates. I was pushing a loba that I cracked with my kraber because her teammate was down but she got off the batt before I could get her so I blunder a knock. Teammate manages to stick the revive and I recover the misplay by stealing the 3rd team's mobile respawn and dropping back in our lifeline. It would have been cooler if I hit the kraber no-scope at the end but I got the last 3 kills to finish it so I felt good about the recovery.
